#Android Native NSLogger Client

Android Debug Bridge ([adb](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html)) is an amazing tool for android development. Nonetheless, its combination with UI component [Logcat](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/logcat.html) is just pain in the neck.

This project is intended to fix the issue with leveraging the power of [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger).

Detailed information, implementation and example will be added. Stay tuned.
